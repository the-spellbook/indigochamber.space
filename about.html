                    <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/lLeCB7Kn-VE?t=13">hello, it's me. i've thought about us for a long, long time... (what?)</a>
                    <br><br>
                    hi, i'm quinten laur√®nce sol (they/them). i'm a second year Music & Technology student at HKU University of the Arts in Utrecht, habited in Rotterdam.
                    <br><br>
                    i'm mainly a record producer, musician, and artist, but frankly, i generally just do whatever gives me inspiration, whether it's coding a new site for the 4th time, obsessing over tiny details in a mix or finding the <a href="tofu.html">best way to cook with tofu.</a>
                    <br><br>   
                    in my free time i also like to read, philosophize about life stuff, collect vintage records, cook, or just drift away whilst lying in a park somewhere (or anywhere else).
                    <br><br>
                    on the 18th of april i released my debut self-titled mini album indigo chamber, which is mostly dreamy, ambient pop dealing with themes such as melancholy, yearning for the past and escapism.
                    <br><br>
                    i'm also active in a label called MlemRecords, which is a creative community of artists, musicians, producers, and designers. the mini album i was talking about earlier was also released on Mlem. <a href="https://mlemrecords.com">check us out here!</a>
                    <br><br>
                    and i'm in a band called <a href="https://instagram.com/apertureband_">Aperture</a> with fellow HKU student Anton Bos and drummer Fedde Doornekamp. we make silky smooth sailin' yachtrock and easy-listening cocktail party AOR for when you feel like decadently escaping from all your earthly troubles. we're still working on our debut, but more on that soon...
                    <br><br>
                    if you want to know more about my work and what i've made or done, you can go to the portfolio section of my site and see some more stuffs i've worked on.
