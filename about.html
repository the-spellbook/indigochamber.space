                    <p><br>quinten laur√®nce sol (they/them) is a creative peculiarity currently habited in rotterdam, the netherlands...
                    <br>they write, sing, produce, mix, code and design, and also like to discover new music, read, or simply just drift away from the world from time to time.
                    <br><br>their current occupation is a solo musical project called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/indigo.chamber"><b>INDIGO CHAMBER</b></a>, which could be described as dreamy, floaty pop music with sultry falsettos and languid guitarlines, originating from some place far away from our known universe.
                    <br><br>currently a student of Music and Technology at HKU University of the Arts, they recently conquered their place in cyberspace because apparently, coding your own site is all the rage nowadays!
                    <br><br>they're also in a band called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/apertureband_/"><b>APERTURE</b></a> where they make silky smooth sailin' yachtrock and easy-listening cocktail party AOR for when you feel like decadently escaping from all your earthly troubles.
