                    <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/lLeCB7Kn-VE?t=13">hello, it's me. i've thought about us for a long, long time... (what?)</a>
                    <br><br>
                    hi, i'm quinten laur√®nce sol (they/them). i'm a second year Music & Technology student at HKU University of the Arts in Utrecht, habited in Rotterdam.
                    <br><br>
                    i produce and write songs and i'm what the cool kids call a multi-instrumentalist... i mainly make music but i generally just do whatever gives me inspiration, 
                    whether it's recoding my portfolio site for the 14th time, reading old dusty books i found in some vague second hand store, or finding the <a href="tofu.html">best way to cook with tofu.</a>
                    <br><br>   
                    in my free time i also like to read, philosophize about life stuff, collect vintage records, cook, or just drift away whilst lying in a park somewhere (or anywhere else really!).
                    <br><br>
                    on the 18th of april i released my debut self-titled mini album <a href=bio.html>indigo chamber</a>, which is mostly dreamy, ambient pop dealing with themes such as melancholy, yearning for the past and escapism.
                    it was mianly self-produced, written, recorded and mixed, with some help and collaborations of fellow HKU friends!
                    <br><br>
                    i'm also active at <a href="https://mlemrecords.com">MlemRecords</a>, which is a creative community of artists, musicians, producers, and designers. the mini album i was talking about earlier was also released on Mlem. <a href="https://mlemrecords.com">check us out here!</a>
                    <br><br>
                    and i'm in a band called <a href="https://instagram.com/apertureband_">Aperture</a> with fellow HKU student Anton Bos and drummer Fedde Doornekamp.
                    we make silky smooth sailin' yachtrock and easy-listening cocktail party AOR, for when you feel like decadently escaping from all your earthly troubles. we're still working on our debut, but more on that soon...
                    <br><br>
                    if you want to know more about my work and what i've made or done, you can go to the <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> section of my site and see some more stuffs i've worked on.
