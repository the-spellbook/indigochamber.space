                    <br><br>
                    hi, i'm quinten laur√®nce sol (they/them). i'm a second year Music & Technology student at HKU University of the Arts in Utrecht, and i produce dreamy, melodic, intimate pop music.
                    <br><br>
                    i'm mainly a songwriter, producer, record engineer and coder, but frankly, i generally just do whatever gives me inspiration, whether it's coding this site, obsessing over tiny details in a mix or finding the <span>best way to cook with tofu.</span>
                    <br><br>   
                    in my free time i also like to read, philosophize about life stuff, collect vintage records, cook, or just simply drift away in a park.
                    <br><br>
                    on the 18th of april i released my debut self-titled mini album indigo chamber, which is dreamy, ambient pop music dealing with themes such as love, melancholy, yearning for the past and escapism.
                    <br><br>
                    i'm also occasionally active in a label called MlemRecords, which is a creative community and 
                    i'm also in a band called Aperture with fellow HKU student Anton Bos and Fedde Doornekamp, where i make silky smooth sailin' yachtrock and easy-listening cocktail party AOR for when you feel like decadently escaping from all your earthly troubles. we're still working on our debut ep, more on that soon...
                    <br><br>
                    if you want to know more about my work and what i've made or done, you can go to the portfolio section of my site and check it all out.
