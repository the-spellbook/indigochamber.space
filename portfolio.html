                        <p>april 18th, 2025</p>
                        <p>i released my first self-titled debut mini album "indigo chamber" on MlemRecords not so long ago. it was mainly self-produced, performed, written, sung and mixed at home, with help of some friends at MlemRecords.
                            it was composed, written, recorded and produced over the span of a few years, where the goal was to express myself and to explore my own style and sound in pop music composition. 
                            another important motivation was to put my commitment and discipline to my projects and ideas to the test, and to create something i can be proud of and want to share with people.
                            <br>releasing this mini album was an important milestone for my growth as an autonomous artist and musician. next to putting myself on the map, i put a series of personal songs into the world 
                            which mean a lot to me emotionally, with some songs dealing with themes such as escapism, mental illness and letting go of the past.

                        </h5>
                        <p>march 18th, 2025</p>
                        <p>on march 18th, i released "where'd you go" together with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wurfwain/">Wurfwain</a>, the first single of my mini album. a dreamy escapade telling the story of two people longing to reconnect despite knowing better. 
                            we wrote and produced this song together for a HKU assignment, for which we had to compose and produce something using a musical device called "pendulum chords"; two musical chords alternating off of eachother. 
                            we used this technique to our advantage by repetitively using the chords throughout the song, creating a hypnotic harmonic base for a dreamy song.

                        <p>march 17th, 2025</p>
                        <p>for HKU we had to reinterpret a piece of music selected from a list of classics, with the intention of becoming aware of our creative artistry and individuality. 
                            i chose to reinterpret Het Dorp by Wim Sonneveld, making a more intense, aggressive and melancholic version inspired by early shoegaze and modern psychedelia. 
                            highlighting my roots in dreampop and shoegaze, i used the nostalgia apparent in the song to make a connection from the french original to a more personal version.

                        for another HKU assignment, we had to choose a few different countries/scenes which each member of our group would represent in a faux international collaboration.
                        we chose rural England, Italy, industrial England and Cura√ßao. i worked together with fellow HKU students Peter, Sander and Tobias. we made a very interesting mix of
                        60s psychedelic folk, tumba music, 80s dreampop and italian movie soundtracks, trying new things out whilst still staying true to what we like.
