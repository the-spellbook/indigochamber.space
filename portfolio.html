                        <p>april 18th, 2025</p>
                        <p>i released my first self-titled debut ep "indigo chamber" on MlemRecords not so long ago. it was mainly self-produced, performed, written, sung and mixed at home, with help of some friends at MlemRecords.
                            it was composed, written, recorded and produced over the span of a few years, where the goal was to express myself and to explore my own style and sound in pop music composition. 
                            another important motivation was to put my commitment and discipline to my projects and ideas to the test, and to create something i can be proud of for the rest of my life.
                            <br>releasing this ep was an important milestone for my growth as an autonomous artist and musician. next to profiling yourself as an artist and soldifying your sound,
                            i brought a series of personal songs into the world which mean a lot to me emotionally, with some songs dealing with themes such as divorce, mental illness, escapism and learning to let go.

                        </h5>
                        <p>march 18th, 2025</p>
                        <p>on march 18th, i released "where'd you go" together with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wurfwain/">Wurfwain</a>. a dreamy escapade telling the story of two people longing to reconnect despite knowing better. 
                            we wrote and produced this song together for a HKU assignment, for which we had to compose and produce something using "pendulum chords"; two musical chords alternating off of eachother. 
                            we used this technique to our advantage by repetitively using the chords throughout the song, creating a hypnotic, trance-inducing piece of music.

                        </h5>
                        <p>march 17th, 2025</p>
                        <p>for a HKU assignment we had to reinterpret a piece of music selected from a list of classics, with the intention of becoming aware of our creative artistry and individuality. 
                            i chose to reinterpret Het Dorp by Wim Sonneveld, making a more intense, aggressive and melancholic version inspired by early shoegaze and psychedelia. 

                            highlighting my roots in dreampop and shoegaze, i used the yearning for the past apparent in the song to connect the threads from the french original to modern alternative pop music.
